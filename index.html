            James McConkey Robinson (June 30, 1924 – March 22, 2016) was an American scholar who retired as Professor
            Emeritus of Religion at Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, California, specializing in New Testament
            Studies and Nag Hammadi Studies. He was a member of the Jesus Seminar and arguably the most prominent Q and
            Nag Hammadi library scholar of the twentieth century. He was also a major contributor to The International Q
            Project, acting as an editor for most of their publications. Particularly, he laid the groundwork for John
            S. Kloppenborg's foundational work into the compositional history of Q, by arguing its genre as an ancient
            wisdom collection.
